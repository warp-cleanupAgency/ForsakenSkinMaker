# ForsakenSkinMaker
An easy to use forsaken skin maker (clientsided) (PC ONLY)

Welcome to the Forsaken Skin Maker!

# Introduction
You don't need any lua experience for this, only basic knowledge of how dex works and how roblox animation IDs/model IDs/model publishing works, all the functions are premade for you and you only have to use them!
This is OPEN SOURCE so the code is open, and you can add extra skin behavior code into your script if you know what you're doing. I don't care if you don't credit me for your skins, im making this out of passion.

# How To Use

First, Insert this line of code into the top of your screen and add some sort of seperator such as ----------------------
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warp-cleanupAgency/ForsakenSkinMaker/refs/heads/main/skinfunctions.lua", true))()

after you insert that into the script, you can make your skin
[[BEFORE YOU START MAKING YOUR SCRIPT, MAKE A RIG IN STUDIO. HERE IS A MODEL OF ALL THE FORSAKEN KILLERS SO YOU CAN USE THAT AS A BASE: ]]
